Let me help analyze the equations and spot some optimizations.

When we solve |b₁ - b₂| < 2L and b₁ + b₂ > 2L:

Case 1: If b₁ > b₂
- Then b₁ - b₂ < 2L
- And b₁ + b₂ > 2L
- Adding these: 2b₁ > 4L
- Therefore b₁ > 2L

Case 2: If b₂ > b₁
- Then b₂ - b₁ < 2L
- And b₁ + b₂ > 2L
- Adding these: 2b₂ > 4L
- Therefore b₂ > 2L

This gives us a key insight: At least one of the bases must be greater than twice the leg length!

Here's how we can use this in our code:

```cpp
// After finding a pair of equal sticks for legs (L)
int legLength = Lvalues[0];
int twiceL = 2 * legLength;

// We only need to consider values > 2L for at least one base
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if(a[i] == legLength) continue;  // skip leg values
    
    // If this potential base > 2L
    if(a[i] > twiceL) {
        // Look for another base
        for(int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if(a[j] == legLength) continue;
            
            // Check both conditions
            if(abs(a[i] - a[j]) < twiceL && a[i] + a[j] > twiceL) {
                cout << a[i] << " " << a[j] << " " << legLength << " " << legLength << endl;
                return;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This optimization helps because:
1. We can skip checking pairs where neither value is > 2L
2. We need to check fewer combinations
3. It's mathematically guaranteed to find all valid solutions

Would you like me to provide the complete optimized solution with this insight incorporated?
